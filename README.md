# Data structure and Algorithms

This is a personal repository which I use to store some code examples
and some notes that I take when I studying things related to algorithms and Data Structures

### What I will find in this repository?

You will find some examples with explanations about:

- BigO notation (Python)
- Stack (C)
- Graph Theory (Python)
